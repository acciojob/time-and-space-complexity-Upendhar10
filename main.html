	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>
    I want to become a software developer because I enjoy writing code that is both powerful and efficient. 
    Learning about algorithms and understanding their Time complexity helps me write programs that 
    perform well even with large inputs. Optimizing for time complexity is crucial in building scalable and 
    responsive applications.

    I am also fascinated by how memory is used in programs. Understanding <b>Space Complexity</b> 
    allows me to make decisions that reduce memory usage, especially in environments with limited resources. 
    For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of <em>O(n)</em> means that the memory required grows 
    linearly with the size of the input, which is an important factor in choosing the right approach.
